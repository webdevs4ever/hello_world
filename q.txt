Now the Pirple journey starts...

I'm just, tryin' to stay above water y'know
Just stay busy, stay workin'
Puff told me like, the key to this joint
The key to stayin', on top of things
Is treat everythin' like it's your first project, you know what I'm sayin'?
Like it's your first day like back when you was an intern
Like, that's how you try to treat things like, just stay hungry
Uh, uh, yes, yes
Y'all wanna know, why he don't stop?
Y'all wanna know, why he don't flop?
Let me tell you pe-eople why
Came from the bottom of the block I
When I was born, it was sworn, I was never gon' be shit
Had to pull the opposite out this bitch
Had to get my ri-ide on
Eyes on the prize, Shawn knew I had to
Had to, had to get these chips
Had to make moves like Olajuwon
Started out sellin' dimes and nicks
